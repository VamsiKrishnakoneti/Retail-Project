1. Data Cleaning (Python)
- You likely handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies in product names, categories, or sales figures.
- Used Pandas for preprocessing and NumPy for numerical adjustments.
- Applied feature engineering to extract useful insightsâ€”like creating customer cohorts based on purchase behavior.
2. Data Modeling (SQL)
- Structured the database with tables for customers, transactions, products, and sales performance.
- Used JOIN operations to integrate datasets for deeper insights.
- Designed constraints and indexes to improve query efficiency.
- Likely formulated aggregate queries to calculate total revenue, profit margins, customer retention, etc.
3. Visualization (Power BI)
- Created interactive dashboards for stakeholders.
- Used DAX formulas for advanced calculations and metrics.
- Displayed customer segmentation, top-selling products, profit trends, and regional sales performance.
- Incorporated filters and slicers to allow dynamic analysis.
Key Insights You Might Have Found
- Best-performing product categories driving revenue.
- Customer purchasing trends, such as frequency and seasonal preferences.
- Profitability analysis by brand or store region.
- Sales decline patterns that indicate inventory mismanagement.
